# terraform-azurerm-avm-res-datafactory

## Upgrade notes

Terraform 1.9 or later and AzureRM 4.x are required. Existing Data Factory and private endpoint resource addresses are unchanged.

Private endpoint locks and role assignments are now created when configured; earlier versions ignored these settings. Remove those settings before upgrading if they are not intended. Optional `subresource_name` and IP configuration `member_name` values now take effect, retaining `dataFactory` and `Azure Data Factory` as their defaults.

When two or more `private_endpoints` in the same resource group omit `name`, their generated names now include a bounded map-key component and hash so they do not collide. Unnamed endpoints in different resource groups retain the legacy default. A sole unnamed endpoint keeps the previous `pe-<factory-name>` default, even if other endpoints have explicit names. **Upgrade caution:** changing from one unnamed endpoint to multiple unnamed endpoints in the same resource group (or back) changes generated names and may force Azure endpoint replacement. To add another endpoint without replacing an existing unnamed one, explicitly set the existing endpoint's `name` to its current `pe-<factory-name>` before changing the map. Review `terraform plan` before applying.

This is a template repo for Terraform Azure Verified Modules.

Things to do:

1. Set up a GitHub repo environment called `test`.
1. Configure environment protection rule to ensure that approval is required before deploying to this environment.
1. Create a user-assigned managed identity in your test subscription.
1. Create a role assignment for the managed identity on your test subscription, use the minimum required role.
1. Configure federated identity credentials on the user assigned managed identity. Use the GitHub environment.
1. Search and update TODOs within the code and remove the TODO comments once complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As the overall AVM framework is not GA (generally available) yet - the CI framework and test automation is not fully functional and implemented across all supported languages yet - breaking changes are expected, and additional customer feedback is yet to be gathered and incorporated. Hence, modules **MUST NOT** be published at version `1.0.0` or higher at this time.
> 
> All module **MUST** be published as a pre-release version (e.g., `0.1.0`, `0.1.1`, `0.2.0`, etc.) until the AVM framework becomes GA.
> 
> However, it is important to note that this **DOES NOT** mean that the modules cannot be consumed and utilized. They **CAN** be leveraged in all types of environments (dev, test, prod etc.). Consumers can treat them just like any other IaC module and raise issues or feature requests against them as they learn from the usage of the module. Consumers should also read the release notes for each version, if considering updating to a more recent version of a module to see if there are any considerations or breaking changes etc.
